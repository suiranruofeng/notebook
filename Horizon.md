The ==_particle horizon_== marks the region from within which we may have received light.
- It started out at zero, because light from nowhere had had the time to reach us, and increased as time went by because light from increasingly larger distance reached us.
- Due to the expansion it will always increase in physical size, but due to the _accelerated_ expansion, there is a limit to the region of the Universe that we will ever be able to receive light from. Today, the particle horizon is 46 Glyr (billion lightyears) away, and the limit — in the far future — is the part that _today_ is 63 Glyr away (but in the far future will be much farther away).
The ==_event horizon_== can be thought of as sort of the opposite. At any time $t$, it is the distance from which we will be able to receive light.
- If the Universe contained no dark energy, there would be no limit to how distant a galaxy could be and we would still be able to see it — just wait long enough. However, the accelerated expansion means that an increasingly smaller part of the Universe will be able to emit light toward us with us receiving it, before the expansion carries the photons away faster than they can travel toward us.

共动距离和共动时间的那张图（最下面这张）表示宇宙如果被“冻结”即不考虑膨胀视界的情况
但为什么第一张图的事件视界在t=0时距离也在0？
